## Best Practices

- Utilized TypeScript for full type safety, ensuring robust code.
- Leveraged React and React Hook Form for optimized code structure and performance.
- Used Tailwind CSS for efficient and responsive styling, adhering to modern design principles.
- Followed consistent naming conventions and separated concerns to maintain code clarity and readability.

## Project Structure

The project structure is designed with simplicity and clarity in mind, consisting of the following key components:

- **Components**: This folder contains only two essential components:

  - `SearchForm`: Responsible for rendering the flight search form.
  - `DetailsTable`: Displays the retrieved flight details in a tabular format.

- **Types**: Inside the `types` folder, an interface has been declared to ensure type safety throughout the project, enhancing robustness and maintainability.
